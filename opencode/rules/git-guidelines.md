# Git Usage Guidelines

## CRITICAL: Commit Policy

**NEVER commit changes unless the user EXPLICITLY asks you to commit.**

This is the most important rule. Examples of explicit requests:
- ✅ "commit these changes"
- ✅ "create a commit"
- ✅ "git commit this"
- ✅ "save this to git"

Examples that are NOT explicit requests to commit:
- ❌ "save this" (could mean save file, not commit)
- ❌ "looks good" (just approval, not commit request)
- ❌ "make these changes" (just asking for code changes)
- ❌ User says nothing after you make changes

**When in doubt, DO NOT commit. Ask the user first.**
